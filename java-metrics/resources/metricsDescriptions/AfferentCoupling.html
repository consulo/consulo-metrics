        This metric reports the number of afferent couplings for each
        package. An afferent
        coupling is a reference from a class or interface external to the
        package to a
        class or interface internal to the package. Test classes and library
        classes are
        not included for purposes of this metric. For more information on
        the afferent coupling
        metric and how it is used, see <a>http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf</a>.
        Note that the definition of afferent coupling we use differs
        slightly from the original,
        as it takes into account the strength of dependencies between
        classes.
