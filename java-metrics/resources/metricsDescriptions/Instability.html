        This metric reports the instability of a package. The instability of a package is defined
        as ratio of the package's efferent couplings to the sum of the package's afferent and efferent
        couplings. For more information on the instability metric and how it is used, see
        <a>http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf</a>. Note that the
        definition of instability we use differs slightly from the original,
        as it takes into account the strength of dependencies between classes.
