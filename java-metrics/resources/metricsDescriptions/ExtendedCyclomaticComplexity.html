        This metric reports the extended cyclomatic complexity of each non-abstract method.
        Cyclomatic complexity is a graph-theoretic measure of the number of distinct paths
        through each method, augmented by a measure of the complexity of the decision points.
        In practice, it is basically 1 + the number of branch points in the method plus the
        number of logical 'and' and 'or' operations. Cyclomatic complexity also represents
        the minimal number of tests necessary to completely exercise a method's control flow.
