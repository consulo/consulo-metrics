        This metric reports the Response For Class value of the class.
        The Response For Class is defined as the number of possible
        methods that may be called when a class is sent a method send.
        In practice, this is the sum of the number of methods in the class,
        plus the number of methods that the class may directly call.
        Classes with high Response For Class may be less stable,
        and require higher amounts of integration testing.
