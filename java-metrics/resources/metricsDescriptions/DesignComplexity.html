        This metric reports the design complexity of a method. The design complexity
        is related to how interlinked a methods control flow is with calls to other
        methods. Design complexity ranges from 1 to V(g), the cyclomatic complexity of
        the method. Design complexity also represents the minimal number of tests necessary
        to exercise the integration of the method with the methods it calls.
